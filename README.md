# \<polymer-particles\>

A polymer integration with particles.js!

Special thanks to Vincent Garreau for his amazing library!

Checkout his [Github](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js) here!
Also, the configurator for the particles is [here!](http://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/)

## Description
`polymer-particles` brings you an easy way to use the already easy particles.js library. Just add your URL to your configuration file and you're ready to go.

Example:

```
<polymer-particles></polymer-particles>
```

### Usage

3. Install with bower
